The Hotel Management System is a comprehensive software application for managing various aspects of a hotel, including room reservations, customer information, and room management. This README provides an in-depth guide on how to set up, use, and contribute to the project.

## Introduction

The Hotel Management System is designed to simplify and streamline hotel operations. It offers the following key features:

- **Room Management:** Easily add, edit, and remove rooms, including details like room type, price, and availability.

- **Reservation Management:** Create, update, and cancel reservations. Check room availability and assign rooms to guests.

- **Customer Management:** Maintain customer records, including contact information and booking history.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for efficient hotel management.

**Access the Login Screen **

If you forget your password, there is usually an option such as "Forgot Password" on the login screen. You can use this option to reset your password and create a new one.

**Note**: Keep your username and password secure and do not share them with anyone. Additionally, it's important to change your password regularly for security reasons.

While using the Hotel Application, please consider your privacy and security. If you have any questions or issues, feel free to contact the application's support team.
